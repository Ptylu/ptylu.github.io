Hovewer, if attacker uses powershell for attack (ATT-25-002), EventLog 4663 will trigger during the creation (but 4663 generates lot of Event). Below screenshot of the ATT-25-002: 25-1-minint-powershell-4663.png  {B} Will still log Event until reboot or Service: Stopped 25-2-set-service-powershell.png This action will modify the Registry Key: 25-4-registry-key-disable-service.png {C} Stopping the Windows Event Log service is a little more special than most other services. If the Windows Event Log service is enabled (automatically or manually), the attacker must first disable the Network List service. Explanation: When the Windows Event Log service stops, it tries to stop the Network List service. By default, this Network List service cannot be stopped unless we disable this service. So, if the Network List Service is not disabled, it will always restart and therefore the Windows Event Log Service will not be able to stop. To summarize, the 2 processes that an attacker has to follow to stop the Windows Event Log Service are <br>- Disable the Windows Event Log Service (and then stop the Windows Event Log Service if attacker doesn't want to wait the machine reboot for the change to take effect). <br>- Disable the Network List Service and then stop the Windows Event Log Service (and also at the same time set as \"disable\" or \"manual\" the Windows Event Log Service to keep this change after the computer reboots): 25-3-stop-service-powershell.png The picture below shows the Network List service to disable BEFORE to stop the Windows Event Log service (if not disabled): 25-3_2-disable-network-list-service.png Windoas warnings the user that the Network List service will be stopped (if not already stopped and disabled): 25-3_3-prompt-before-stop-service.png The warning doen't display the Network List service (because already stopped and disabled): 25-3_4-prompt-before-stop-service-list-service-stopped.png Picture of broken EventViewer after {B}+reboot or {B}+{C}: 25-3_1-stop-service-powershell-eventviewer-error.png {D} EventLog for Process Creation Disabled 25-5_2modification-audit-configuration-process-creation-4719.png {E} Registry Modification. This log is stored in the old EventLog file (Security.evtx). the new file (Not-Important-Log.evtx) configured doesn't contain this log: 25-6-modification-evtx-registry-4657.png"},
