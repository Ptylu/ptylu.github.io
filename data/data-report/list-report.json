      { "Report-ID": "25", "Mitre Attack ID": "T1562.002", "Technique": "Disable Windows Event Logging", "Mitre CAR ID": "Pushed-in-CAR-2022-03-001", "Comment": "Even if EventLog are disabled and re-enabled, actions launched during the log disabled will be logged when log are re-enabled (we do not lose the logs (even with a reboot), unless the time shift is exceeded).", "Definition": "There are different ways to perform this attack. -- The first one is to create the Registry Key \"HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\MiniNt\". This action will not generate Security EventLog 4657 or Sysmon EventLog 13 because the value of the key remains empty. However, if an attacker uses powershell to perform this attack (and not cmd), a Security EventLog 4663 will be generated (but 4663 generates a lot of noise). -- The second way is to disable the service EventLog (display name Windows Event Log). After disabed, attacker must reboot the system. The action of disabling or put in manual the service will modify the Registry Key value \"HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\EventLog\\start\", therefore Security EventLog 4657 or Sysmon EventLog 13 will be generated on the system. -- The third way is linked with the second. By default, the EventLog service cannot be stopped. If an attacker tries to stop the service, this one will restart immediately. Why ? Because to stop completely, this service must stop others, one in particular called netprofm (display name Network List Service). This service remains running until it is disabled. So Attacker must either disable EventLog and after to stop it or disable netprofm and after stop EventLog. Only stopping the service (even as admin) will not have an effect on the EventLog service because of the link with netprofm. Security EventLog 1100 will log the stop of the EventLog service (but also generates a lot of noise because it will generate a log everytime the system shutdown). We can stop the service (with Stop-Service) only if we disable it with the commands Set-Service or sc config. Direct modification of the registry key using reg add, New-ItemProperty, Set-ItemProperty will disable the service only after system restart. -- The fourth way is to use auditpol.exe  to modify the audit configuration and disable/modify important parameters that will lead to disable the creation of EventLog. -- The fifth way is to modify the Registry Key value \"HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\EventLog\\Security\\file\" (or other kind of log) to modify the path where the EventLog are stocked. Importantly, with this technique, the EventViewer will use the value of the Registry Key \"file\" to know where to find the Log. Thus, using the EventViewer will always show the current event logs, but the old one will be stocked in another evtx. Also, the location of the file must be writable by the Event Log service and should only be accessible to administrators. Attacker can also decrease the maxsize value of the Log to force the system to rewrite on the older EventLog (but the minimum cannot be less than 1028 KB). As the Registry key is modified, Security EventLog 4657 or Sysmon EventLog 13 will be generated on the system. All of these attacks required administrative right. Attacks number three, four and five do not require a system reboot to be effective immediately. -- The sixth it's to use the Powershell command \"Remove-EventLog -LogName Security\" to unregister sources. {M} This action is the only one that disables Logs AND deletes EventLogs {M} -- The last one discovered during my LAB is a new way to disable Security EventLog without needing the administrator privilege (tested on Microsoft Windows [Version 10.0.17763.1935]). A non-admin user can modify the \"start\" value in the registry \"HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\WMI\\Autologger\\EventLog-Security\" to completely disable the Security EventLog. However the system reboot is required to take effect. After the reboot, a System Eventlog 22 is generated and the Security EventLog will be Completely Unavailable. Adversaries may also modified the \"start\" value in the registry \"HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\WMI\\Autologger\\EventLog-System\" and \"HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\WMI\\Autologger\\EventLog-Application\" to disable all the EventLog and will be Partially Unavailable. Administrator privilege required. Adversaries may also modify the \"enabled\" values in \"HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\WMI\\Autologger\\EventLog-Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon-Operational\\{5770385f-c22a-43e0-bf4c-06f5698ffbd9}\" or value \"start\" in \"HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\WMI\\Autologger\\EventLog-Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon-Operational\" and Sysmon EventLog will be Completely Unavailable. Administrator privilege required. {IN} We can define the result of the logs availability in 3 categories: - Completely Unavailable (lost after the configuration revert) - Partially Unavailable (available after the configuration revert (if log rewriting not done)) - Available in Other File (available in other location) {IN}", "Example": "{A} Because MiniNt key doesn't need value (empty key), the 4667 and 13 EventLog will not log the creation of the key. Hovewer, if attacker uses powershell for attack (ATT-25-002), EventLog 4663 will trigger during the creation (but 4663 generates lot of Event). Below screenshot of the ATT-25-002: 25-1-minint-powershell-4663.png  {B} Will still log Event until reboot or Service: Stopped 25-2-set-service-powershell.png This action will modify the Registry Key: 25-4-registry-key-disable-service.png EventLog 7040 if use of 003: 25-2-set-service-powershell-log-7040.png {C} Stopping the Windows Event Log service is a little more special than most other services. If the Windows Event Log service is enabled (automatically or manually), the attacker must first disable the Network List service. Explanation: When the Windows Event Log service stops, it tries to stop the Network List service. By default, this Network List service cannot be stopped unless we disable this service. So, if the Network List Service is not disabled, it will always restart and therefore the Windows Event Log Service will not be able to stop. To summarize, the 2 processes that an attacker has to follow to stop the Windows Event Log Service are <br>- Disable the Windows Event Log Service (and then stop the Windows Event Log Service if attacker doesn't want to wait the machine reboot for the change to take effect). <br>- Disable the Network List Service and then stop the Windows Event Log Service (and also at the same time set as \"disable\" or \"manual\" the Windows Event Log Service to keep this change after the computer reboots): 25-3-stop-service-powershell.png The picture below shows the Network List service to disable BEFORE to stop the Windows Event Log service (if not disabled): 25-3_2-disable-network-list-service.png Windoas warnings the user that the Network List service will be stopped (if not already stopped and disabled): 25-3_3-prompt-before-stop-service.png The warning doen't display the Network List service (because already stopped and disabled): 25-3_4-prompt-before-stop-service-list-service-stopped.png Picture of broken EventViewer after {B}+reboot or {B}+{C}: 25-3_1-stop-service-powershell-eventviewer-error.png EventLog 1100 after the EventLog Service correctly stopped: 25-3_5-eventlog-service-stopped-1100.png {D} EventLog for Process Creation Disabled 25-5_2modification-audit-configuration-process-creation-4719.png {E} Registry Modification. This log is stored in the old EventLog file (Security.evtx). the new file (Not-Important-Log.evtx) configured doesn't contain this log: 25-6-modification-evtx-registry-4657.png {F} During my LAB, I discovered a new way to disable Security EventLog without needing the administrator privilege (tested on Microsoft Windows [Version 10.0.17763.1935]). As we can see below, a non-admin user can modify the value \"start\" in the registry EventLog-Security to completely disable the Security EventLog. However the system reboot is required to take effect: 25-7-non-admin-start-0.png After the reboot, a System Eventlog 22 is raised and Security EventLog will be Completely Unavailable. (The event logging service encountered an error while initializing publishing resources for channel Security. If channel type is Analytic or Debug, then this could mean there was an error initializing logging resources as well): 25-7-autolloger-error-22.png Attack also tested on EventLog-Application, EventLog-System, EventLog-Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon-Operational and EventLog-Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon-Operational\\{5770385f-c22a-43e0-bf4c-06f5698ffbd9} but these commands require administrator privilege: 25-7-complete-denied.png The modification of \"start\" value in EventLog-Application and EventLog-System will completely disable the EventLog-Security access but will be only Partially Unavailable. After the modification of one of these 2 Registry Keys and a reboot, we can see the EventLog service is not able to start anymore (even if service is not disabled): 25-7-service-cannot-start-system-start.png The modification of \"start\" value in EventLog-Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon-Operational and  and \"enable\" value in EventLog-Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon-Operational\\{5770385f-c22a-43e0-bf4c-06f5698ffbd9} will completely disable the Sysmon log and will be Completely Unavailable. For the modification of EventLog-Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon-Operational, all the Sysmon EventLog are unavailable: 25-7-sysmon-start-error.png For the modification of EventLog-Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon-Operational\\{5770385f-c22a-43e0-bf4c-06f5698ffbd9}, an error EventLog 255 will be available in the Sysmon Log: 25-7-sysmon-enable-error.png. However, no other new Sysmon EventLog can be generated, only the old EventLog before the modification are still available. {G} Removing Security source with Remove-EventLog command: 25-G-Remove-EventLog.png As we can see, after the command launched, EventLog are still logged 25-G-Remove-EventLog-log.png However, after the reboot, new EventLogs are not logged anymore and the access to Security Eventlog from EventViewer is not possible. We cn still have access to logs between the command and the reboot when we open the security.evtx from Explorer 25-G-old-log-available.png"},
